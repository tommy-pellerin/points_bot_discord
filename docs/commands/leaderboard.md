# Display top 10 members Leaderboard (admin only)
`/leaderboard` command

The `leaderboard` command displays the top 10 contributors of a Discord server based on their point balance.

***What is the difference from the `public_leaderboard` command?***

- `public_leaderboard` is visible to everyone, shows avatars but does not tag users.
- `leaderboard` is visible only to the user who executed the command, does not show avatars but tags users.
