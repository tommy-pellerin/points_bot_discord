## Where is it installed ? 💿

Following [Discord documentations](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/overview-of-apps#where-are-apps-installed), Discord apps can be installed in two different contexts:

1. Apps installed to a server (called a guild throughout the API) by a user with the Manage Server (MANAGE_GUILD) permission. Apps installed to a server can only be used within that server and DMs with the app's bot user, and are visible to all server members.
2. Apps installed to a user account. Apps installed to a user are visible only to that user, across all of their servers, DMs, and Group DMs by default.

The installation contexts that an app supports can be limited by the developer when setting up the app. Details about installation contexts are in the Application resource documentation.
